# Bracket to Dot Notation Transformation Implementation Summary

## Overview

The implementation successfully transforms bracket notation to dot notation for includes in the Fractal API, supporting any level of nesting. This allows for a more convenient syntax when specifying included relationships in API requests.

## Example Transformations

The implementation correctly handles the following transformations:

### Simple case:
```
type(id,code) -> type.id,type.code
```

### Nested case (from issue description):
```
id,art_id,document_id,document(id,operation_date,created_at,type_id,type(id,name,code))
```
Transforms to:
```
id,art_id,document_id,document.id,document.operation_date,document.created_at,document.type_id,document.type.id,document.type.name,document.type.code
```

### Complex nested cases:
```
user(id,profile(name,email,address(city,country)))
```
Transforms to:
```
user.id,user.profile.name,user.profile.email,user.profile.address.city,user.profile.address.country
```

## Implementation Details

The implementation consists of four key methods:

1. `transformBracketToDotNotation`: The main method that takes a string of includes with bracket notation and transforms it to dot notation.
2. `processBracketNotation`: Processes a single segment with bracket notation and transforms it to dot notation.
3. `findMatchingClosingBracket`: Finds the matching closing bracket for a given opening bracket position.
4. `splitTopLevelCommas`: Splits a string by commas, but only at the top level (ignoring commas inside brackets).

### Key Features

1. **Recursive Processing**: The implementation uses recursion to handle nested bracket notations. When a field contains bracket notation, it's processed recursively, allowing for any arbitrary depth of nesting.

2. **Bracket Matching**: The implementation correctly matches opening and closing brackets, even in complex nested structures, by keeping track of the nesting level.

3. **Top-Level Comma Splitting**: The implementation correctly splits strings by commas only at the top level, ignoring commas inside brackets. This is crucial for handling nested structures.

## Conclusion

The current implementation successfully handles the transformation of bracket notation to dot notation for includes in the Fractal API, supporting any level of nesting. This allows for a more convenient syntax when specifying included relationships in API requests.

The implementation has been thoroughly tested with various test cases, including simple cases, the specific example from the issue description, and additional complex cases with multiple levels of nesting. All tests have passed, confirming that the implementation works correctly.
